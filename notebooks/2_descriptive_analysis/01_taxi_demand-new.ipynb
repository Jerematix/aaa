Else the demand difference is negative or zero. For places more in the south of Chicago and more on the periphery have a lower demand difference, so the ending trips are not as prominent as the other places.

    "It can be observed that there is a higher idle time around periheral areas in Chicago, possibily due to the patterns that we have seen in the analyis before, that in these areas there are less starting and ending trips, so in generall less demand for Taxis. Possible reasons that we mentioned were due to the alternative transport options, longer distances resulting in higher fares and lower residental population."

    "To summarize this notebook, we observed higher Taxi Demand in the city center the Loop, the Northern areas above the city center like Lincoln Park, the Southern parts around Hyde Park and the two Airports O'Hare International and Midway International. Linking this observation with other observations from the **Temporal Demand Patterns and Price Analysis** and **POI Notebook** and research, we can explain these patterns for each area like this:\n",
    "- The City Center has higher amount of activities like sustenance, arts and culture, sports and education leading to the highest Taxi Demand\n",
    "- The Northern areas, above the city and nearer to the river side, have more residential areas that have less access to public transport, so the Taxi Demand is higher\n",
    "- The Southern areas around Hyde Park have several museums, the University of Chicago and a park near the Lake located there, leading to higher Taxi Demand in these parts\n",
    "- Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Chicago Midway International Airport have higher demand in general due to them being important transportation hubs. In the morning there are more ending trips and in the evening more starting trips likely due to business travel and its timely nature\n",
    "- Peripheral areas have less Taxi demand likely due to a lower population density, better access to public transport and higher cost of Taxi Demand due to its farer distance to the city center\n",
    "\n",
    "For an outlook, more POIs can be studied in relation to Taxi Demand. Chicago is a place with a lot of criminal activities, so the influence of that can also be analyzed in relation to Taxi Demand. "
